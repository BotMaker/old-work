i think it might be better to build the
game engine in small steps

like building the movement system and then
the combat system

need a good movement system that runs
fast even with 200 units
100 player 100 enemy limited

so far the movement system is still
quite slow and there are still problems
with the units moveing around the map
without gettings stuck in trees
once all these problems are fixeds
then would need to move on to the
combat system

the combat system needs to work
well

affter the combat system there workers
and building systems


the game would need some sort of story
mode buit up by useing the tigger editor
and heros charertes

would like to have a network verions
but thats way of could build a network
game where there are only units that
get given to you at the start to battle
with the enemy could be a two player game
where you both fight each other would only
need the movement system and combat system
to make this game plus could choose the
zarg or human race to fight with more
of a taticl rts game 

what about some high ground where units
can fire from and get bounce attack
power for attack form high ground would
need some new isomcl sprites i don't have
any


would need a user interface
for saveing and loading games

c++ version of this game might be required
to have 200 plus units in the game and
then there are buildings that would need
more computeing power i don't think the
euphoria version will run very fast on a 
slow computer like my 1.73 ghz cpu 1gb ram
128 graphics card
